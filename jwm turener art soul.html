           Turner isthe best-loved English Romantic artist. He became known as 'the painter of light', because of his increasing interest in brilliant colours as the main constituent in his landscapes and seascapes. 

 entered the Royal Academy Schools in 1789. His earliest works form part of the 18th-century topographical tradition. He was soon inspired by 17th-century Dutch artists such as Willem van der Velde, and by the Italianate landscapes of Claude and Richard Wilson. <br>
           Living and working in 19th-century London, the English painter is known for his interest in powerful subject matter, as evident in both his sublime landscapes and studies of modern machinery. While Turner is seen as a pioneer of Romanticism, he is most celebrated for facilitating the emergence of modern art.
